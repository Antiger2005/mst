Section~\ref{sec:deep:algchoice} discusses our algorithmic and implementation
efforts to efficiently find MSTs.  This includes as a detailed review of their
performance.  Section~\ref{sec:deep:io} presents how we efficiently handle I/O.
Section~\ref{sec:deep:graphgen} describes our approach to quickly generating
representative graphs.  Finally, the framework in which we carried out
experiments is briefly described in Section~\ref{sec:deep:framework}.
