\subsection{Graph Generation}
\label{sec:deep:graphgen}

\paragraph{}
Briefly discuss how we generate graphs. Touch on our various approaches
(complete, sparse, or dense) as well as relevant optimizations and perhaps how
we ensure the output is connected.  Definitely discuss random number generation.
