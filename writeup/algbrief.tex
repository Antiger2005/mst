\dgu{Briefly describe our best overall algorithm here.}
Our program dynamically chooses between a version of Kruskal's and a
version of Prim's
algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree based on the density of the
graph. Our optimized Kruskal's
algorithm is faster for most graphs with the exception of extremely dense
ones. Prim's is implemented with an adjacency matrix so it is faster for
graphs with an $|E|$ value of at least 80\% the maximum possible for a
given $|V|$.

We implemented Kruskal's using a Union-Find data structure similar to the
one described in the textbook. It maintains a set of vertices in a
connected component and a ``parent'' value for each connected component
for easy comparison of two connected component.

We would like to submit our project to the competition. As asked for in
the FAQ, our total running time on a graph with 20,000 nodes and 2,000,000
edges is 0.2 seconds.
