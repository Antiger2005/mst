This is a simple list of #defines we have in our code.  The macro name has an
underscore on either side if it is a toggle macro - e.g. define it to turn it
on, and otherwise it is off.  Macro names not in this form have some value
associated with them.

#define _DEBUG_
  Enables extra debugging code.  Enabled by default for debug builds.

#define _NO_FLOATS_
  Enables integer-only mode.

#define INPUT_TYPE {SCANF, MMAP}
  Sets which input reader to use (default is SCANF):
    SCANF: a simple scanf reader
    MMAP:  memory-mapped reader

#define ALG {BEST_ALG, KRUSKAL_*, PRIM_DENSE, PRIM_BHEAP, KKT}
  Sets which algorithm to use (default is BEST_ALG):
    BEST_ALG: choose the algorithm based on empircal density results
    KRUSKAL_EXPLICIT_FS: use kruskal's algorithm with explicit sets and full sort
    KRUSKAL_EXPLICIT_PS: use kruskal's algorithm with explicit sets and partial sort
    KRUSKAL_IMPLICIT_FS: use kruskal's algorithm with implicit sets and full sort
    KRUSKAL_IMPLICIT_PS: use kruskal's algorithm with implicit sets and partial sort
    PRIM_DENSE: Prim's algorithm for dense graphs
    PRIM_BHEAP: Prim's algorithm with binary heaps
    KKT: Karger-Klein-Tarjan randomized algorithm

#define GRAPH_TYPE {EDGE_LIST, HEAPIFIED_EDGE_LIST, ADJACENCY_LIST, ADJACENCY_MATRIX}
  Sets which kind of data structure to use populate when reading an input graph.
